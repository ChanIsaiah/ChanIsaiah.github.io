Komekko (こめっこ) is Megumin's younger sister and a member of the Crimson Demons.
<br>
Komekko has a lively and cheerful attitude. Like her sister she is very smart (demonstrated when she solved the puzzle Host had been working on far longer) and cunning, but still shows a great deal of childish innocence. She exhibits a constant hunger, eating whatever is put in front of her, and has tried to cook Chomusuke on several occasions.</p></b></font>
